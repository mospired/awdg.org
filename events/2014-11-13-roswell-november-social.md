**NEW LOCATION - The Roswell Tap**

Things will kick off around 6:30pm, get here when you can, we go strong until about 9. Come thirsty, hungry, and ready to talk with Atlanta's Northside Web Heads. </p><p>Join your fellow designers, developers, tweeters, and friends for an evening of fun and conversation. You'll be glad you did.

We have a private room upstairs, use the stairs out back or the stairs inside.
