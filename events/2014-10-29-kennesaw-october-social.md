Join a group of your fellow Web Heads at the new Tin Lizzy's Cantina in Kennesaw. This is your chance to talk to someone else who understand the difference between IA, UX, and UI. If that's not you come anyway.

We'll kick off the chips and salsa eating contest at 6:30. RSVP now and I'll see you soon!
