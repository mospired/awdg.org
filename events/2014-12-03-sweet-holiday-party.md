## We are doing it again!

Push the work aside and pick up a peppermint stick (or schnapps, if you’re truly into holiday spirits) while you ring in the holiday cheer with a few hundred of your closest friends.

### What's this SWEeT thing?

Glad you asked. SWEeT = Social, Web, Entrepreneurs & Tech. It's a cooperation between [ATDC](http://atdc.org/), [Atlanta Tech Village](http://atlantatechvillage.com/), [AWDG](http://www.awdg.org), [Hypepotamus](http://www.hypepotamus.com/), [StartupAtlanta](http://startupatlanta.org/), and [StartupChicks](http://startupchicks.org/).

It's everyone in our wonderful ecosystem of hard working, tech loving, movers and shakers in Atlanta. You know, Connected Awesomeness and all. It you, too, so you should be there.

Do you represent a group that would like to join us? <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/2014-sweet-holiday-party-partners-tickets-14165325871">Let us know</a>. We'd love to have you.

Yes. Yes we did. Our sponsors have gifted us with gelt, so everyone get two free drinks. The munchies will be plentiful, too.Wait. <b>Did you say free drinks?</b>

### Where is it, you ask?

Midtown is the epicenter of all things SWEeT in Atlanta, and RiRa Irish Pub is right in the middle of Midtown. With plenty of parking, lots of great food and drinks, and a great festive atmosphere, it's the place to be on Dec 3rd.

### Get your tickets now.

Nothing lasts forever, and space is limited. So call on Donner, Dasher, Prancer and …was it Vixen? Anyway, the point is, slip on your most dashing decorative apparel and join us for this year’s very happening holiday party.

*Your ticket includes admission to the party, free food, and 2 drink tickets. And remember, all proceeds go to Bert's Big Adventure.</i>

### Spread the Word!

Tell some friends on Twitter and Facebook. Everyone loves a party. Ho-ho-hope to see you there!
