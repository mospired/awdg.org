  My name is Jason and I'll be the locahost for this event. If you arrive and are trying to find us, I'll be wearing a bright red AWDG t-shirt and I'll have a red AWDG sign near the group as well.

The days are getting shorter, the weather is getting cooler and the holidays are fast approaching but the Decatur Social goes on! If you'll be in town on the Monday before Thanksgiving, join us at The Marlay for an evening of fun and techie conversation.

See ya there!
