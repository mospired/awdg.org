  <p class="lead">In this full-day workshop, Vitaly Friedman (editor-in-chief of <a href="http://smashingmag.com">Smashing Magazine</a>), will present <b>practical techniques, clever tricks and useful strategies</b> you need to be aware of when working on any responsive design project. Most techniques are borrowed from mid-size and large-scale real-life projects, such as large eCommerce projects, online magazines and Web applications. We won't cover the basics, but rather advanced and innovative examples of RWD in action.</p>
  <p class="lead">This workshop is intended for professional designers, developers and everybody else who is dealing with responsive design regularly or wants to better understand responsive design in general. You should at least be familiar with some basics of responsive design, HTML5 and CSS.</p>
  <h3>The workshop will provide you with:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Front-end strategies for scalable, resolution-independent graphics and maintainable CSS with SVG and icon fonts</li>
    <li>Approaches to manage common performance bottlenecks including Web fonts, responsive images and secondary content</li>
    <li>Real-life techniques to approach RWD projects and improve their performance and loading times,</li>
    <li>Performance optimization techniques for responsive sites as well as lessons learned from Smashing Magazine's own redesign and refactoring,</li>
    <li>Effective tools and techniques that can support and enhance your personal workflow when working on any responsive design project.</li>
  </ul>
