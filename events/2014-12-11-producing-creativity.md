<div class="event-details">
  <p class="lead">Since we used GitHub to build the new AWDG website, we decided to invite them down to speak with you! Hear from Steve Smith on Dec. 11th on Producing Creativity. Feeling stuck, and can't get the creative juices flowing again? Attend Steve's presentation. He'll share his best tips to reinvigorate your creativity. </p>
  <p>In the realm of UX, it's even harder to be creative. With so much information out there, it's difficult to craft something simple, with a purpose. Steve will walk you through the UX process, and show you how to be creative again.</p>
