Things will kick off around 6:30pm, get here when you can, we go strong until about 9. Pure Taqueria has an awesome menu and upstairs patio, so come thirsty, hungry, and ready to talk with Atlanta's Northside Web Heads.</p><p>Join your fellow designers, developers, tweeters, and friends for an evening of fun and conversation. You'll be glad you did.
