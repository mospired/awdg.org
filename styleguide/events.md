# Event Modules

Events can be broken down into several modules. There are general content modules: [Header](headers.html), Actions; and event-specific sub-modules: [Description](#description), [Speaker](#speaker), [Location](#location), [Sponsors](#sponsors).


## Description

The main Description container is a `<div>`, but you can use `<section>` if you prefer. Either way, be sure to include `class="description"` on the element for it to inherit the proper styles.

```
<div class="description">
  ...
</div>
```
